In a proof of stake system such as Cardano,            stakeholders have an obligation to take part in the protocol.            To make this practical, stakeholders are able to delegate their            obligations to others — so-called stake pools — which are able to fulfill the obligations.            Stake pools operate core nodes that are online at all times and take part in the protocol            and produce blocks in the blockchain."},{body:"In layman terms, Staking is used to generate blocks on blockchain as similar to mining in          bitcoin or ethereum.
